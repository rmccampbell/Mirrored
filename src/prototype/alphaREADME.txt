For our alpha, our main goal was to implement the mechanics involving enemies, switches, and dying.

To beat the level, the player must get to the exit door in the top corner.

The controls are still the same——arrow keys are to move and the movements of the characters are mirrored.

There are now enemies which will kill you if you touch them. You can set off a switch however which will open a trapdoor
for the enemy to fall in.

There is also another switch which completes the bridge over a gap and allows the player to cross to the exit door.

Enemies die by falling into a trapdoor and the player dies by either touching an enemy or falling into the gap.
